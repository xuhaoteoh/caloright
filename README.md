Hello! This is the Github Repository for our Shiny App.
Our Shiny App is here: https://xuhaoteoh.shinyapps.io/Caloright/

The original dataset is from here: https://www.kaggle.com/niharika41298/nutrition-details-for-most-common-foods

The app.r file is the main code file for our shiny app.
The R scripts for testing before implementation are in the folder "R Code".
The pictures in our shiny app are in the folder "www".
nutrients_cleaned.csv is the cleaned dataset.
presentation.Rpres is the file for our presentation.

To reproduce the app, the files that needed to be downloaded are: www(folder), app.R and nutrients_cleaned.csv.
